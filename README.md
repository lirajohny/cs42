# CS50 Exercises Adapted for School 42 Methodology

Welcome to the repository containing an adaptation of the CS50 exercises to the learning methodology of School 42. In this repository, we've transformed the CS50 exercises to align with the unique approach followed at School 42, where you're encouraged to create your own functions instead of relying on existing ones.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge kicks off with the task of implementing printing functionality using only the `write` function, as opposed to the usual `printf`. This sets the tone for the subsequent exercises, which involve tasks like printing numbers and finding creative ways to obtain user input without relying on the traditional `gets`.

## Motivation

This repository is a testament to my dedication to enhancing my programming skills. By adapting the CS50 exercises to the School 42 methodology, I've not only deepened my understanding of programming concepts but also honed my problem-solving skills. I'm excited to share my efforts with the community, as I believe it can be a valuable resource for fellow learners who are navigating similar challenges.

Feel free to explore the exercises, learn from the adaptations, and contribute to the ongoing journey of improvement. Let's continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge and build a supportive learning community together.
